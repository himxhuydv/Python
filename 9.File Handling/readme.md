# File Handling
File Handling is basically a technique used in the programming language for creating, storing, reading, deleting, updating, shifting, and organising the data which is inside the file.
**What's the need of it?**
When a program is running, during that phase our data which we upload and the output which is generated by the program are saved in the main memory (RAM), also called temporary memory. So during that phase, when we close the program, the whole data which is stored in the main memory gets automatically erased. And we as humans can't do anything about that at the programming level.That is where the File Handling comes in. It stores our input data as well as the generated data of the program from the main memory to secondary memory.And we can do all sorts of things using File Handling (example: read, create, delete, store, etc.) to the file.**Remember, not all the data gets saved into the file; only the data that the program wants gets saved.**
