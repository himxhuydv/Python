#     tuple  
#          its store multiple data types but it is immutable u cannot change anything here 

# tuple=(1,2,3,4,5)
# print(type(tuple))
                                                                                                                      
# empty tuple()
# tuple=()
# print(type(tuple))

# one tuple elemen in it 
# tuple=(1,)
# now this is a single tuple or it will call int 
# print(type(tuple))

# a=(1,45,342,3424,False,"Rohan","Shiva")

# count function
#              for checking how many time the element came 
# print(a.count(45))
 
# concatenation operation
                        # its use to add two tuple together 
# b=(1,2,3,4,5)
# a=('e','j','r','d','e')
# print(b+a)


# membership operation 
# use for checking for the element to check it is present or not 
# my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
# membership=(2 in my_tuple)
# print(membership)


# repetion function  
# in  thia  u can multiply the time u want the repetition
# a=(1,2,4,4,5,6,7,8)
# print(a*2)

# unpacked function
# use for packing a variable of tuple into anther variable 
# n=(1,2,3)
# a,c,b=n
# print(a,c,b) # as u can see i packed the abc wiht 123

# slicing function
# my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,67,8,9) # from now on i using this tuple
# print(my_tuple[0:8:1])

# min / max
#  function used for finding the max and the mini value
# print(max(my_tuple))
# print(min(my_tuple))

#  index function 
#    mean u can find the index by the element enteries 
# print(my_tuple.index(2))

# length function 
#   used for the knowing the total lenth of thr tuple
# print(len(my_tuple))
