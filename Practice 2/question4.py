# use comparison operator to find that out whether a given variables b is greater than or not take a=34 and b=80

# # we take a=34 and b=80
# a=34
# b=80
# print("is a is greater than b is",a>b)

# let makes this more enjoyable by taking user input bbut this is only for checking b is greater or not
# a=int(input("enter the value of a :"))
# b=int(input("enter the value of b :"))
# print("b is greater then a is ",b>a)
