#  dictonires works as the way of key values in this u know that u can use the key for printing not the indexing but the key for values print 

marks={"harrry":200,
       "shubham":50,
       "ragav":20}
# print(marks,type(marks)) we now know the type of datatype is dictinorie and the printing way

# print(marks[2]) here we dont use the indexing instead we use the key 

#  output using the key 
# print(marks["harry"]) # here as u can see the key is the harrry and we are getting the value by the help of the key 

# print(marks,["ragav"])
