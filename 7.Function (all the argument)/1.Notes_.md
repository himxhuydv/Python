# FUNCTION
**so basically the function is a block of that can take** 
* **input:** do some
* **process:** and then give 
* **result:** in the end.

this combined  work as  structure and perfomed a specific task.
its like using the same logic again and again so for that we use function which perfome code reusebility that can done by calling that particular function

function can be  two types:
1.built in function 
which comes the print()statment or u can say the pre defined function like 
max(),min(),pow()
2.user defined function 
which user created that  function to reduced the max block of code and easy to call multiple time and easy to modify in single block
example: def gm(a,b), def greater(a,b),def lessthen(a,b)

 ## SYNTAX OF FUNCTION

**AND IN FUNCTION** 
def functioname(parameter):
indentation (  logic  )
indentation (  result  )

PARAMETER are the things u going to call during() ok 


**PASS feature in function**
if u want to leave the function on purpose for doing later u can use the pass statment it will not give error if u leave undefined 
``` def function(): ```
(indentation) pass
#now with this u can edit that when ever u like if u leave it without pass it will give indentation error 

## ARGUMENTS:
there are 4 kind of argument 
**1.Required argument**
**2.Default argument**
**3.Keyword arguument**
**5.Variable length argument**
 
Now lets just take about them
**1.Default argument**:in these argument we give the value in the paramter or u can say we give the default values there u just have called the functionname() and parathensis it will perfome function which is written 
**more like this**
```def functionname(a=3,b=3):```
```add=a+b```
```print(add)```
```functionname()``` # without the argument or u can say without giving any values its still give the addtion of a+b=3 how our code works as the code start the after calling the funtion it will check the parameter and in the parameter we have already given the a=2,b=3 so it will take and do the addition


**2.required argument**: in these argument u need give the each argument in it you have to write like this
 #always remember one thing u have to give non default values first  first then the default values later
```def functionname(c,a=2,a=4)```
```(indentation)  add=a+b```
```(indentation)   print(add)```
```functioname(c=23)```
 #in these u have to give proper argument in it . or else it will show  error in the code 
 **3.Keyword argument**: in these argument u have to give the same argument and there value as u written as in function parameter if in the parameter  but order does not matter as example,u can give it as (a,b,c) or(c,a,b) and during calling(c=2,b=2,c=4)
 ```def functionkeyword(a,c,b):```
 ```(indentation) add=a+b+c```
```(indentation) print(add)```
now calling the function
```functionkeyword(c=2,a=2,b=1)``` in these u can see that the order is change but i have given total argument a value as given in the parameter
**4.Variable length argument**:in these used for the give parameter as list,tuple,dict,set. so in these paramter we give a name in paranthesis and * for tuple,list and ** for dict and these ways 
```def additionthroughvariablelength(*number):```
   ```(indentation) product=0```
   ``` (indentationfor i in number:```
 ```   (indentation)   product+=i```
  ```(indentation) print("this is ouput of variable length :",product)```
```name=(1,2,3,4,5)```
```additionthroughvariablelength(*name)```

**And for last return**
return:this is given in the function to store the result or output or the processed part of the function write in the line u want to take the proceesed value and save it in the  variable in the where function is called. lets take the additionthroughvariablelenth() function
```def additionthroughvariablelength(*number):```
   ``` product=0```
 ```   for i in number:```
   ```     product+=i```
   ``` return print("this is ouput of variable length :",product)```#so return used to store the executed process in the variable
```name=(1,2,3,4,5)```
```additionis=additionthroughvariablelength(*name) ```as u can see the function output is will be save in anykind of variable
