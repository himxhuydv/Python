# FUNCTION
**so basically the function is a block of that can take** 
* **input:** do some
* **process:** and then give 
* **result:** in the end.

this combined  work as  structure and perfomed a specific task.
its like using the same logic again and again so for that we use function which perfome code reusebility that can done by calling that particular function

function can be  two types:
1.built in function 
which comes the print()statment or u can say the pre defined function like 
max(),min(),pow()
2.user defined function 
which user created that  function to reduced the max block of code and easy to call multiple time and easy to modify in single block
example: def gm(a,b), def greater(a,b),def lessthen(a,b)

 ## SYNTAX OF FUNCTION

**AND IN FUNCTION** 
def functioname(argument):
indentation (  logic  )
indentation (  print  )

ARGUMENT can be n number just pass it in () ok 


**in the function**
if u want to leave the function on purpose for doing later u can use the pass statment it will not give error if u leave undefined 
''' def function():
(indentation) pass
     now with this u can edit that when ever u like if u leave it without pass it will give indentation error 
     
## ARGUMENTS:
there are 4 kind of argument 
1.default argument 
2.
