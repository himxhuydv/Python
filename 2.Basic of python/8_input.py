# now by  we take input by user and we do sum 

#  we do small test in this concatenate (consider it as  join or link between things)

# a=input("enter the value of number 1;") #entery will be taken as string
# b=input("enter the value of number 2;")
# print(a+b)  #now this due to the contentation of stringits get join beacuse we tale entry as a string 

# so for the number to get sum 

a=int(input("enter the number 1:"))
b=int(input("enter the second number 2:"))
c=a+b
print("the sum of 2 number is :",c)
